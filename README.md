# AgriWeather IoT Platform

## Overview

AgriWeather is an IoT-based weather monitoring platform designed for agricultural applications. The platform enables farmers and agricultural professionals to make data-driven decisions about crop planning, irrigation scheduling, and farm management through real-time weather data collection and analysis.

## Project Components

This project is being developed as part of the IoT & Cloud Computing course and will include:

- **IoT Device Simulator**: Simulates weather sensors collecting environmental data (temperature, humidity, rainfall, soil moisture, wind speed)
- **Cloud Storage**: Azure Blob Storage for secure data storage
- **Backend REST API**: RESTful API for data access and business logic
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line interface for platform management and data access
- **Architecture**: C4 model diagrams
- **Cost Analysis**: Azure Pricing Calculator estimates
- **Postman Collection**: Complete API testing collection with example requests
