# Business Context - AgriWeather IoT Platform

## Executive Summary

AgriWeather is an innovative IoT-based weather monitoring platform designed specifically for agricultural applications. The platform provides real-time weather data collection, storage, and analysis to help farmers and agricultural professionals make informed decisions about crop planning, irrigation scheduling, and overall farm management.

## Problem Statement

Modern agriculture faces significant challenges related to weather unpredictability and climate change. Farmers often lack access to:
- Real-time, localized weather data for their specific fields
- Historical weather patterns for long-term planning
- Actionable insights for irrigation and crop management
- Cost-effective weather monitoring solutions

These gaps lead to:
- Inefficient water usage and increased costs
- Suboptimal crop yields
- Difficulty in planning planting and harvesting schedules
- Reactive rather than proactive farm management

## Solution Overview
